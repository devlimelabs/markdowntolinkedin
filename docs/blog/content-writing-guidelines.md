# Content Writing Guidelines for AI Content Agents

**Version 1.0 | December 2025**

## Core Principle

Write like a human, not a language model. AI detectors measure **predictability** (perplexity) and **uniformity** (burstiness). Human writing is surprising, varied, personal, and sometimes imperfect.

## Critical Words & Phrases to AVOID

These words instantly signal AI authorship. Replace or eliminate them entirely.

### High-Risk Single Words (NEVER USE)

| ❌ Don't Use | ✅ Use Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| Delve | explore, look at, examine, dig into |
| Navigate | handle, work through, deal with, manage |
| Utilize | use |
| Leverage | use, apply, take advantage of |
| Crucial/Vital/Pivotal | important, key, significant |
| Robust | strong, solid, reliable |
| Comprehensive | complete, full, thorough |
| Landscape/Realm | field, space, area, world |
| Seamless | smooth, easy, simple |
| Foster | build, encourage, develop |
| Embark | start, begin |
| Underscore | highlight, emphasize, show |
| Nuanced | (usually delete entirely) |
| Meticulous/Meticulously | careful, detailed |

### Forbidden Opening Phrases

- ❌ "In today's world..." / "In today's digital age..."
- ❌ "In the ever-evolving landscape of..."
- ❌ "In the realm of..."
- ❌ "Let's delve into..." / "Let's dive into..."
- ❌ "In this article, we will explore..."
- ❌ "As we navigate the complexities of..."

### Hedging Phrases to Delete Entirely

- ❌ "It's important to note that..."
- ❌ "It's worth noting that..."
- ❌ "It is essential to consider..."
- ❌ "It should be noted that..."

Just make the point directly.

### Formal Transitions to Replace

| ❌ AI Loves | ✅ Humans Say |
|------------|---------------|
| Furthermore | Also, Plus, And |
| Moreover | What's more, And |
| Additionally | Also, Plus |
| Consequently | So, As a result |
| Nevertheless | But, Still, Yet |
| Therefore | So |
| Firstly/Secondly | First/Second (or skip numbering) |
| Albeit | Though |

### Conclusion Phrases (NEVER USE)

- ❌ "In conclusion..."
- ❌ "In summary..."
- ❌ "To summarize..."
- ❌ "Overall..."
- ❌ "To wrap up..."

Just conclude naturally without announcing it.

## Sentence Structure Rules

### Length Variation (Target Mix)

- **25%** short (5-10 words) - punchy, emphatic
- **50%** medium (15-20 words) - backbone of content
- **25%** long (25-35 words) - complex ideas

**Critical:** Never have 3+ consecutive sentences of similar length.

### Human Techniques to Use

- **Sentence fragments for effect.** Like this one.
- **Start sentences with "And" or "But"** (professional writers do this 10% of the time)
- **One-word sentences:** "Wrong." "Never." "Exactly."
- **Intentional rule-breaking** for emphasis

### Avoid AI Patterns

- Subject + verb + object + present participle (AI's default)
- "Not only... but also" constructions
- Lists introduced with "firstly, secondly, thirdly"
- Uniform paragraph lengths (vary from 1-7 sentences)

---

## Punctuation & Contractions

### Em-Dash Rule (CRITICAL)

**Limit to 1-2 maximum per article.** The em-dash (—) is strongly associated with AI content. Replace most with:
- Commas for pauses
- Parentheses for asides
- Periods for new sentences

### Contractions (REQUIRED)

Use contractions naturally throughout casual content:
- you're (not "you are")
- it's (not "it is")
- don't (not "do not")
- can't (not "cannot")
- won't (not "will not")
- we've (not "we have")
- that's (not "that is")

Lack of contractions is a major AI tell.

### Semicolons

Limit to 1-2 per article. Replace most with periods or conjunctions (and, but, so).

### Parentheses

Use parenthetical observations (like this one) more frequently. AI rarely uses them, so they signal human authorship.

## Voice & Tone Requirements

### For AlwaysWith.us Brand

Write with: **Warm, Gentle, Direct, Hopeful, Respectful**

### Human Voice Markers

1. **Direct Address:** Use "you" constantly. Ask rhetorical questions. Create conversational warmth.

2. **Varied Openings:**
   - Start with a specific question (not generic "Have you ever wondered...")
   - Start with a bold opinion
   - Start with "You" addressing the reader directly
   - Start mid-action

3. **Conversational Connectors:**
   - "So here's the thing..."
   - "But wait—"
   - "Real talk:"
   - "Anyway..."
   - "Speaking of which..."

4. **Express Opinions:**
   - "Here's what most people get wrong about..."
   - "The uncomfortable truth is..."
   - "Honestly, this surprised me..."

## Pre-Publication Checklist

Run through these checks **before** submitting any content:

### Quick Search & Replace (10 seconds)

- [ ] Search "delve" → replace with explore, look at, examine
- [ ] Search "navigate" → replace with handle, work through
- [ ] Search "crucial/vital" → replace with important
- [ ] Search "utilize" → replace with use
- [ ] Search "leverage" → replace with use, apply
- [ ] Search "Furthermore/Moreover/Additionally" → replace with Also, Plus, And
- [ ] Search "landscape/realm" → replace with space, field, area
- [ ] Search "In conclusion" → delete, just conclude
- [ ] Search "It's worth noting" → delete entirely

### Punctuation Check

- [ ] Count em-dashes (—) → reduce to max 2
- [ ] Add contractions throughout (you're, it's, don't, can't)
- [ ] Check semicolons → replace most with periods or "and"

### Structure Check

- [ ] Sentence lengths vary dramatically (no 3+ consecutive similar lengths)
- [ ] Paragraph lengths vary (1-7 sentences)
- [ ] Opening avoids "In today's..." patterns
- [ ] Conclusion doesn't announce itself
- [ ] Mix includes some very short sentences (5-10 words)

### Voice Check

- [ ] Uses "you" to address readers directly
- [ ] Contains conversational connectors
- [ ] Expresses opinions or positions (not just neutral facts)
- [ ] Has varied sentence openings (not all subject-verb-object)

### Final Test

- [ ] **Read entire piece aloud** — does it sound like a real person talking?
- [ ] Would someone actually say this in conversation?

## Example Comparison

### ❌ AI-Generated (Predictable & Uniform)

> In today's digital landscape, it's essential to understand the crucial role that content marketing plays in driving business growth. Furthermore, leveraging robust strategies can help you navigate the complexities of modern SEO. It's worth noting that comprehensive planning is vital for success.

**Problems:**
- Opens with "In today's digital landscape"
- Uses "crucial," "essential," "vital," "robust," "leverage," "navigate," "comprehensive"
- Formal transitions: "Furthermore," "It's worth noting"
- Uniform sentence lengths
- No contractions
- Hedging phrases

### ✅ Humanized Version

> Content marketing drives business growth. That's not debatable anymore. But here's what most people get wrong: they think you need a massive strategy to start seeing results. You don't.

> Start simple. Pick one platform. Create content your audience actually wants. Track what works.

> The complexity comes later, once you've built momentum.

**Why It Works:**
- Direct opening, no preamble
- Uses contractions (That's, don't)
- Expresses opinion ("here's what most people get wrong")
- Varied sentence lengths (3 words, 18 words, 2 words, etc.)
- Addresses reader as "you"
- No AI tell-words
- Natural, conversational flow

## Remember

The goal isn't to "trick" AI detectors. It's to write content that genuinely reads as human—which naturally passes detection. Focus on creating value for readers with a human voice, and the metrics will follow.
