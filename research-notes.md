# Research Notes: How to Make Text Bold in LinkedIn Posts

## Key Findings

### Why Bold Text Matters
- LinkedIn feed has 2+ million posts daily with 3+ million active users
- Well-structured posts generate up to 3x more engagement
- 91% of LinkedIn engagements occur on mobile devices
- Organic reach declined by nearly 50% in 2025 due to algorithm changes
- Bold text creates visual anchors that improve readability

### How LinkedIn Bold Text Works (Unicode Method)
- LinkedIn does NOT support native bold/italic formatting
- No keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B, Command+B) work in LinkedIn
- Bold text uses Unicode mathematical alphanumeric symbols
- These are distinct characters that look like styled letters
- Must be generated externally and pasted into LinkedIn

### Manual Method (Without Tools)
1. Open a Unicode text converter/generator in browser
2. Input the phrase or headline to emphasize
3. Select preferred style (Serif or Sans-Serif)
4. Copy the converted text to clipboard
5. Paste directly into LinkedIn post, profile, or message

### Where Bold Text Can Be Used
- Posts (hooks, lists, CTAs)
- About Section (value propositions)
- Experience Section (key metrics)
- Messages (outreach)
- Profile headlines
- Comments

### Downsides and Limitations
- **Accessibility Issues**: Screen readers interpret Unicode as mathematical symbols, confusing visually impaired users
- **Search Visibility**: LinkedIn algorithm indexes standard text, not Unicode symbols
- **SEO Impact**: Formatting core keywords removes them from search results
- **Device Compatibility**: Older devices may display empty boxes instead of letters
- **Should use sparingly**

### Best Practices
- Reserve bold for structural hierarchy, not decoration
- Use for: Headlines, lists, data points, CTAs
- NEVER apply to core keywords or hashtags (hurts SEO)
- Keep primary terms in plain text for discoverability
- Limit usage to maintain readability

### Alternative: Markdown Method
- Write content in markdown format
- Use markdown-to-LinkedIn converter tools
- Easier workflow for developers and content creators
- More efficient than manual Unicode conversion
