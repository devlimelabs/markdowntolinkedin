# Research Notes: How to Bold Text on LinkedIn (Desktop & Mobile)

## Key Findings

### LinkedIn's Native Formatting Limitations
- LinkedIn doesn't support native rich text formatting (bold, italic, underline) in regular posts
- Only plain text is supported in the standard post editor
- LinkedIn Articles DO support native formatting with bold, italic, headings, etc.

### Methods to Bold Text on LinkedIn

#### Method 1: Unicode Text Generators
- Use external tools like YayText, Shield, Typegrow, Taplio, etc.
- These convert text to Unicode characters that LOOK bold/italic
- Works on both desktop and mobile
- Process: Type text → Copy formatted version → Paste into LinkedIn

#### Method 2: LinkedIn Articles
- Native "Write Article" feature supports real formatting
- Can use bold, italic, headings, bullet points
- Best for long-form content
- Available on both desktop and mobile

#### Method 3: Copy from Google Docs/Word
- Can copy pre-formatted text from these apps
- Bold and italic sometimes transfer
- Underlines, strikethrough, colors do NOT transfer
- Inconsistent results

### Desktop vs Mobile Differences

**Desktop:**
- Larger screen for editing and previewing
- Easier to use external formatter tools in browser
- Can use keyboard shortcuts in Articles (Ctrl+B)
- Better for longer, more complex posts

**Mobile:**
- 80% of LinkedIn traffic is mobile (2025 data)
- Same formatting methods work (Unicode generators)
- Can open formatter tools in mobile browser
- Copy/paste works the same way
- Mobile apps available (Text Styler for LinkedIn on iOS)
- Formatting appears identical on both platforms once posted

### Important Considerations

**Accessibility Issues:**
- Unicode bold/italic characters can't be read by screen readers
- Not good for accessibility
- Characters won't be indexed for search purposes
- Don't put keywords in Unicode formatting

**Display Issues:**
- Unicode characters don't appear correctly on old Android devices (show as rectangles)
- This issue is decreasing as devices update

### Best Practices
- Use formatting sparingly (1-2 types per post max)
- Don't over-format with fancy styles (circled, squared text)
- Focus on readability and scannability
- Use spacing, line breaks, and emojis for visual structure
- Preview posts to see "see more" cutoff point
- Keep mobile users in mind (80% of traffic)

### Recommended Tools
- **Typegrow**: Has preview feature, shows "see more" cutoff
- **Taplio**: Similar to Typegrow with preview
- **Shield**: Simple, no login required
- **MarkdownToLinkedIn**: Our tool for markdown conversion
