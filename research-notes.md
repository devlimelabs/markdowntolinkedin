### How LinkedIn Algorithm Works (3-Step Process)
1. **Quality filtering** - Posts classified as spam, low quality, or high quality
2. **Engagement testing** - Shows post to small sample in first hour ("golden hour")
3. **Network and relevance ranking** - Prioritizes posts from people/topics you engage with most

### What Gets Filtered as Spam/Low Quality
- Spammy behavior (tagging unrelated individuals)
- Low-quality content (errors)
- Excessive use of tags (3-5 tags per post is best)
- Too frequent posting (minimum 12 hours between posts)

### Three Ranking Signals
1. **Identity** - Member's location, career, skills
2. **Content** - Relevance based on:
   - Dwell time (how long users spend reading)
   - View and engagement frequency
   - Topic relevance
   - Knowledge/professional advice sharing
   - Language
   - Professional conversation in comments
   - Companies, people, topics mentioned
   - Poster's topic authority (consistent niche posting)
3. **Member Activity** - Past actions, hashtags followed, connections

### 2025 Algorithm Changes
1. **Improved visibility for experts** - Original insights, industry trends, actionable advice
2. **Move away from clickbait** - Detects engagement bait ("Comment YES if you agree!")
3. **Rewarding high-engagement posts** - "Golden hour" system refined
4. **Posts can surface for weeks** - Not limited to first few days if highly relevant

### Key Statistics
- Over 1 billion members
- Algorithm processes billions of posts per day
- LinkedIn is NOT designed for virality
- Focus on professional knowledge and expertise

### LinkedIn's Own Statement
"The primary goal of any algorithm is to make the platform enticing so that people spend more time online"

### How Unicode Formatting Works
- LinkedIn presents profile and post content in plain text
- Can't add normal rich-text formatting (bold, italics, underlines)
- Workaround: Use Unicode text generator (like YayText)
- Copy formatted Unicode text and paste into LinkedIn

### Problems with Unicode Formatting
1. **Not accessible** - Characters cannot be read by screen readers
2. **Not searchable** - Unicode characters won't be indexed for search purposes
3. **Don't put keywords in faux bold/italic** - Won't appear in search results
4. **Old Android devices** - Characters appear as rectangles (less relevant now)
5. **Character count** - Unicode characters may count double against character limits

### Best Practice
- Don't present essential information in Unicode formatting
- OK for fun or non-essential content
- LinkedIn articles DO support real rich-text formatting (no need for Unicode tricks)

### Emojis (Recommended Alternative)
- Great for adding color to plain-text content
- Mac: Ctrl-Cmd-Space
- Windows: Windows-; OR Windows-.

### Key Statistics
- **Posts formatted for readability get up to 3x more engagement** compared to dense, unformatted text
- About 60% of LinkedIn users access the platform on mobile
- Average engagement rate across LinkedIn: approximately 4.2%
- Standard dwell time: 8-10 seconds

### Key Formatting Best Practices
1. **Keep paragraphs to 1-2 lines max** - Use white space for mobile scannability
2. **Frontload your hook** - First two lines determine if people click "See more" or keep scrolling
3. **Add links in comments** - Not in post body to avoid killing organic reach
4. **Use 3-5 relevant hashtags** - Only tag 2-3 people who genuinely add value
5. **Format strategically** - Use emojis, line breaks, and caps for emphasis (but don't overdo it)
6. **Consistent formatting + strong storytelling** - Turns casual readers into engaged prospects

### White Space Rules
- Maximum 3 lines per paragraph
- Add 1 blank line between thoughts (not 2, not 3)
- Paragraphs longer than 3 lines are a "big no"
- Posts with clean spaces, line breaks, and indentation have much higher reach

### Posting Frequency
- Maintain minimum of 12 hours between posts
- Too frequent posting can be flagged as spam
