# Research Notes: How to Bold Text on LinkedIn (Desktop & Mobile)

## Key Findings

### LinkedIn's Native Limitations
- LinkedIn does NOT support native rich-text formatting (bold, italic, underline) in regular posts
- Only LinkedIn Articles feature supports native bold/italic formatting
- Regular post editor has no formatting toolbar or keyboard shortcuts (CTRL+B doesn't work)

### Methods to Bold Text on LinkedIn

#### Method 1: Unicode Text Generators
- Most common method for bold text in LinkedIn posts
- Uses Unicode characters that look like bold text
- Tools mentioned: YayText, Shield, Typegrow, Taplio, Poper, Publer, Flowpost
- Works on both desktop and mobile (same process)

**Process:**
1. Type or paste text into a formatter tool
2. Select bold style from options
3. Copy the formatted Unicode text
4. Paste into LinkedIn post (desktop or mobile app)

#### Method 2: LinkedIn Articles
- Native bold/italic support in LinkedIn's "Write article" feature
- Has formatting toolbar with bold, italic, headings, bullets
- Best for long-form content
- Available on both desktop and mobile

#### Method 3: Copy from Google Docs/Word
- Can copy bold/italic text from external documents
- Bold and italic usually transfer
- Underlines, strikethrough, colors do NOT transfer
- Inconsistent results

### Desktop vs Mobile Differences

**Key Finding:** The process is essentially THE SAME on desktop and mobile
- Both platforms lack native formatting in post editor
- Both require external formatter tools or LinkedIn Articles
- Unicode text pastes the same way on both platforms
- Mobile users can access formatter tools via mobile browser

**Platform-Specific Notes:**
- Desktop: Easier to use multiple browser tabs (formatter + LinkedIn)
- Mobile: May need to switch between apps/browser tabs
- Old Android devices: Unicode characters may appear as rectangles (older issue, less relevant in 2025)

### Important Warnings & Considerations

**Accessibility Issues:**
- Unicode bold characters cannot be read by screen readers
- Not good for accessibility

**SEO/Search Issues:**
- Unicode characters are NOT searchable on LinkedIn
- Don't put keywords in bold Unicode text
- Won't be indexed for search purposes

**Best Practices:**
- Don't use bold for essential information
- Use sparingly for emphasis only
- Avoid over-formatting (looks unprofessional)
- Stick to 1-2 formatting types per post max

### Top Recommended Tools (from research)
1. **Typegrow** - Has preview feature showing "see more" cutoff
2. **Taplio** - Also has preview feature
3. **Shield** - Simple, no login required
4. **MarkdownToLinkedIn** - (Our tool!) Markdown-based approach

### Statistics & Data Points
- LinkedIn has over 1 billion members (2025)
- 80% of LinkedIn traffic is mobile (mentioned in research)
- Post preview "see more" cutoff typically happens at 3rd line
