Ever wonder how people make text **bold** on LinkedIn? You've probably seen it in your feed. A key phrase stands out, grabbing your attention instantly. It’s a simple trick, but it makes a huge difference in a sea of plain text.

But when you go to write your own post, there’s no bold button. Not on desktop. Not on the mobile app. So, how is it done?

It’s not a secret feature; it’s a workaround. And it’s easier than you think. This guide shows you exactly how to add bold text to your LinkedIn posts on any device.

## The Short Answer: How to Bold Text

For those in a hurry, here’s the quick version. LinkedIn doesn’t have a built-in bold button, so you need to use a special text generator.

| Platform | Method | Steps |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Desktop** | Unicode Text Generator | 1. Open a generator site (like our [Markdown to LinkedIn tool](/)). 2. Type your text. 3. Copy the bold version. 4. Paste it into your LinkedIn post. |
| **Mobile** | Unicode Text Generator | 1. Open a generator in your mobile browser. 2. Type your text. 3. Copy the bold style. 4. Paste it into the LinkedIn app. |

That's it. The process is the same for both desktop and mobile. You're just copying and pasting text that uses special Unicode characters to appear bold.

## Why Doesn't LinkedIn Have a Bold Button?

It seems like a basic feature, right? The simple reason is that LinkedIn’s post feed is designed for plain text. Unlike LinkedIn Articles, which have a full formatting toolbar, posts are meant to be simple and uniform. This ensures a consistent look across the millions of posts shared daily.

This limitation forces users to get creative. The most common solution is using Unicode, a standard that assigns a unique number to every character, including different styles of letters and numbers.

When you use a text formatter, you're not actually making the text bold in the traditional sense. You're swapping standard letters for their bold-looking Unicode counterparts. For example, you're replacing the letter 'B' with '𝗕'. They look the same to us, but to a computer, they are completely different characters.

## How to Bold Text on LinkedIn: Desktop Guide

Bolding text from your computer is fast and simple. The easiest way is to use an online text generator.

Here’s the step-by-step process:

1.  **Write Your Post:** Start by writing your content in the LinkedIn post editor.
2.  **Open a Text Generator:** In a new browser tab, open a Unicode text generator. The [MarkdownToLinkedIn tool](/tool) is perfect for this, as it converts markdown (`**bold**`) directly into the correct format for LinkedIn.
3.  **Generate Your Bold Text:** Type the word or phrase you want to bold into the generator. It will instantly create a bolded version.
4.  **Copy and Paste:** Copy the bolded text and paste it back into your LinkedIn post editor. The formatting will appear exactly as you copied it.

And you're done. Your post now has bold text that will catch the reader's eye.

## How to Bold Text on LinkedIn: Mobile App Guide (iOS & Android)

The process on mobile is almost identical to desktop. You'll just be switching between your browser and the LinkedIn app.

1.  **Open Your Mobile Browser:** Launch Chrome, Safari, or whatever browser you use on your phone.
2.  **Go to a Text Generator:** Navigate to a site like `yaytext.com` or another Unicode font generator.
3.  **Type and Copy:** Enter the text you want to bold and copy the generated bold style.
4.  **Paste into the LinkedIn App:** Open the LinkedIn app, start a new post, and paste the copied text where you want it. You can also paste it into comments.

It works seamlessly on both iPhone and Android. While some dedicated formatting apps exist, using a web-based tool is often quicker and doesn't require any installation.

## A Word of Caution: The Downsides of Unicode

Using Unicode for bold text is a great trick, but it has a couple of important drawbacks you should know about.

*   **Accessibility Issues:** Screen readers, which are used by visually impaired individuals, often can't read Unicode characters correctly. They might read the text letter by letter or simply announce it as a series of unknown symbols. This makes your content inaccessible to a part of your audience.
*   **Search Problems:** LinkedIn’s search function may not recognize Unicode characters as standard text. If you bold an important keyword, your post might not show up in search results for that term. It's best to avoid using it for anything critical for SEO.

Because of this, you should use bold formatting for emphasis, not for essential information. Use it to highlight a feeling, a key result, or a call-to-action. Don't use it for names, companies, or keywords you want people to find.

## Make Your Posts Stand Out

Bolding text is a simple but effective way to add visual hierarchy to your LinkedIn posts. It breaks up monotonous blocks of text and guides your reader’s attention to what matters most.

Whether you’re on your desktop computer or your mobile phone, the process is just a quick copy and paste away. Just remember to use it thoughtfully to keep your content accessible and searchable.
