## Why Character Limits Matter

## The Critical "Fold" Lines

Not all characters are equal. Here's what shows before "see more":

**Desktop feed:** ~210 characters
**Mobile feed:** ~150 characters
**Post page:** Full content

> Your hook needs to work within ~150 characters to capture mobile users.

## Strategies for Different Lengths

### Short Posts (Under 300 characters)

Best for:
- Quick tips
- Quotes
- Polls
- Engagement questions

Example:
```
Stop saying "I think."

Say "Based on my experience" or "The data shows."

It's a small change that makes you sound 10x more confident.

## Maximizing Your Space

### Do's

1. **Front-load value** - Put the best content first
2. **Use line breaks** - They don't count toward the limit
3. **Be concise** - Every word should earn its place
4. **Format wisely** - Bold text takes same space as regular

### Don'ts

1. **Don't pad with emojis** - One or two max
2. **Don't repeat yourself** - Say it once, say it well
3. **Don't add unnecessary disclaimers** - Get to the point
4. **Don't stuff hashtags** - 3-5 relevant ones maximum

## Character Counting Tips

Our [Markdown to LinkedIn tool](/) includes:
- Real-time character count
- Warning when approaching 3,000
- Preview of how your post will look

### Manual Counting

If counting manually:
- Spaces count as characters
- Line breaks count as characters
- Emojis count as 2 characters
- Links count at full length

## Unicode Formatting and Character Count

When using Unicode bold/italic (like our tool generates):

| Format | Regular | Unicode |
|--------|---------|---------|
| "hello" | 5 chars | 5 chars |
| **Bold** | Same length | Same length |

Unicode formatting doesn't add extra characters!

## Common Questions
