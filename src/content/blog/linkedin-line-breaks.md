You’ve crafted the perfect LinkedIn post. The hook is sharp, the points are clear, and the insights are valuable. You hit “Post,” and your beautifully structured text collapses into a dense, unreadable wall. Your line breaks are gone.

It’s a frustratingly common problem. But don’t worry, you can fix it. Getting your formatting to stick is simple once you know the rules of the platform.

This guide shows you exactly how to add and preserve line breaks in your LinkedIn posts, so your content stays clean, scannable, and professional.

### The Short Answer: How to Fix Line Breaks

For those in a hurry, here are the most effective methods to control spacing in your LinkedIn content.

| Problem | Solution | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Paragraphs merging in posts | Press **Enter twice** between paragraphs | Standard posts and comments |
| Line breaks disappearing in the "About" section | Edit and save the section using the **LinkedIn mobile app** | Fixing the profile summary bug |
| Inconsistent formatting from other apps | Write directly in LinkedIn or use a **Markdown converter** | Clean, consistent formatting |

### Why Your Line Breaks Keep Disappearing

LinkedIn’s text editor can be a bit unpredictable. The main issue is that it handles text differently depending on where you write it and where you paste it from. Sometimes, when you copy text from another application like Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or even a simple notes app, hidden formatting code comes along for the ride. LinkedIn’s editor often strips this hidden code, and your line breaks disappear with it.

Also, a long-standing bug specifically affects the "About" section on your profile. Edits made on a desktop computer often result in all paragraphs collapsing into one, no matter how many times you press Enter. It’s a known issue that has frustrated users for years.

### How to Add Line Breaks That Actually Work

Let’s get into the practical solutions. These methods will help you control your post’s structure and readability.

#### 1. The Double Enter: Your Go-To for Posts

For regular LinkedIn posts, the simplest and most reliable method is to press **Enter twice** to create a full blank line between your paragraphs. A single Enter will often just move the text to the next line without creating the visual separation you need.

Think of it this way:

*   **Single Enter:** Creates a line break (no space).
*   **Double Enter:** Creates a paragraph break (with space).

This double-enter technique is the standard for creating well-spaced, readable posts that don’t feel cramped. It works consistently across both desktop and mobile.

#### 2. The Mobile App Fix: Solving the "About" Section Bug

If you’re tearing your hair out over the "About" section on your profile, you’re not alone. The fix, oddly enough, is to use your phone.

Editing your profile’s "About" section on the LinkedIn mobile app (for both iOS and Android) bypasses the desktop bug. Any line breaks you add on mobile will be saved and will display correctly on all devices, including desktop.

So, if your summary looks like a jumbled mess, just open the app, make your edits, and save. It’s a strange workaround, but it works.

#### 3. Write Natively or Use a Clean Converter

To avoid formatting issues from the start, you have two great options. First, you can write your post directly in the LinkedIn post editor. This prevents any unwanted formatting from being copied over. You can type out your content and use the double-enter method for spacing.

Your second option is to use a tool designed for this exact purpose. A Markdown-to-LinkedIn converter, like the one on our site, allows you to write in a clean, simple syntax and then converts it to formatted text that LinkedIn understands perfectly. This gives you full control over bolding, italics, and, of course, line breaks, without any hidden code to mess things up.

### Best Practices for Readable LinkedIn Posts

Getting your line breaks to work is just the first step. Now you can focus on making your content easy to read.

*   **Keep Paragraphs Short:** Aim for one to three sentences per paragraph. This creates plenty of white space and makes your content much less intimidating to read, especially on a small mobile screen.
*   **Think Mobile-First:** Over half of all LinkedIn users are on mobile. Short paragraphs and clear spacing are not just nice to have; they are essential for holding a mobile reader’s attention.
*   **Use Spacing for Emphasis:** A single, powerful sentence standing on its own can have a huge impact. Use white space to make your key points pop.

Stop fighting with LinkedIn’s editor and start creating content that looks exactly the way you want. By using these simple techniques, you can ensure your posts are always clean, professional, and easy to read.
