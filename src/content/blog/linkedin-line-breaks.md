## Why Does LinkedIn Remove Line Breaks?

It feels like a bug, and in many ways, it is. The core issue is **copy-paste contamination**. 

When you write in tools like Google Docs, Notion, or Microsoft Word, you’re not just writing text. You’re creating text with hidden formatting code in the background. This includes things like non-breaking spaces and soft returns. When you paste this into LinkedIn, the platform’s editor gets confused. It tries to interpret the messy code, fails, and defaults to collapsing everything into a single block.

According to research by Václav Šulista, LinkedIn also uses multiple versions of its text editor at the same time. Content saved in one editor can look completely different when viewed in another. This explains why a post might look fine on your phone but appear as a text wall to a colleague on their desktop. It’s not you; it’s LinkedIn’s inconsistent rendering.

## Three Reliable Methods to Add Line Breaks

Here are three proven methods to get your formatting to stick, from the most effective to a quick fix.

### Method 1: Use a Markdown-to-LinkedIn Converter (The Best Way)

This is the most reliable solution because it was built to solve this exact problem. A good converter tool strips away all the junk formatting from your original text and converts it into a clean format that LinkedIn understands perfectly.

Using a tool like our [MarkdownToLinkedIn.com converter](/), you just paste your text (written in simple Markdown) and it instantly generates a post ready for LinkedIn. It preserves all your line breaks, bullet points, and bold or italic text without any hidden characters.

**Why it works:** It gives LinkedIn’s editor clean, predictable code, avoiding the rendering bugs entirely.

### Method 2: Write Directly in LinkedIn

If you’re writing a short, simple post, composing it directly in LinkedIn’s post editor can often prevent formatting issues. By typing directly on the platform, you avoid pasting in any problematic code from external editors.

Just be mindful of hitting `Enter` twice to create a full line break between paragraphs. A single `Enter` (or `Shift + Enter`) might only create a soft return, which can disappear after you publish.

**Why it works:** You’re creating the post within LinkedIn’s native environment, so there’s no foreign code to misinterpret.

### Method 3: The Plain Text Trick

This is a classic workaround that solves formatting issues on many platforms. It involves using a plain text editor as a middleman to “clean” your text before pasting it into LinkedIn.

1.  **Copy** your post from its original source (e.g., Google Docs).
2.  **Paste** it into a plain text editor like Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on Mac, make sure it’s in plain text mode).
3.  **Copy** the text again from the plain text editor.
4.  **Paste** it into LinkedIn.

This process strips out all the invisible formatting, leaving you with just the raw text. You will need to re-apply any bolding, italics, or bullet points within LinkedIn, but your line breaks should now be preserved.

**Why it works:** It removes the hidden “copy-paste contamination” that causes LinkedIn’s editor to break.

## Make Your Content Readable

Fixing line breaks isn’t just about aesthetics. It’s about respect for your reader’s time. No one wants to read a wall of text on a busy feed. 

By ensuring your posts are well-spaced and easy to scan, you make your content more inviting and significantly increase the chances that your message will be read and understood. So, take the extra minute to get your formatting right. It’s a small step that makes a big difference.
