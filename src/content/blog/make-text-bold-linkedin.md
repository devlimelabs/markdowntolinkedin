You want your LinkedIn posts to stand out. You’ve seen other people use bold text to emphasize key points, and you want to do the same. But when you press Ctrl+B, nothing happens. What gives?

LinkedIn’s post editor doesn’t have a built-in way to format text. It’s a common frustration. But don’t worry, you can still make your text bold. This guide will show you how to do it manually, without any special tools, and explain why you might want to think twice before you do.

Plus, we’ll show you a much easier and safer way to format your posts.

### TL;DR: How to Make Text Bold on LinkedIn

| Method | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Manual Unicode** | Copy-paste special characters that look bold from a Unicode text generator. | Quick, no tools needed. | Bad for accessibility, not searchable, can look weird on some devices. |
| **Markdown Converter** | Write with simple markdown (`**bold**`) and use a tool to convert it. | Easy, accessible, searchable, consistent. | Requires a simple (and free) tool. |

## The Manual Method: Using Unicode to Fake Bold Text

So, how do people get bold text in their posts without a formatting toolbar? They use a trick. It involves using special characters from the Unicode standard that *look* like bold letters but aren't actually formatted text.

Here’s how you can do it yourself:

1.  **Find a Unicode Text Generator:** Search for a "bold text generator" online. There are many free options available.
2.  **Type Your Text:** Enter the word or phrase you want to make bold into the generator.
3.  **Copy the “Bold” Version:** The tool will output your text using Unicode characters. For example, it will turn `Hello World` into `𝗛𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗼 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱`.
4.  **Paste into LinkedIn:** Copy this new text and paste it directly into your LinkedIn post.

That’s it. Your text now appears bold. Simple, right? Well, not exactly.

### The Hidden Problems with Fake Bold Text

This Unicode method is a clever workaround, but it comes with some serious downsides. Before you start bolding everything, you need to understand the problems you’re creating.

#### 1. It’s a Disaster for Accessibility

This is the biggest issue. People with visual impairments often use screen readers to browse the web. These tools read the content of a page aloud. When a screen reader encounters your “bold” Unicode text, it doesn’t read the word. Instead, it might read out the name of the character, like “Mathematical Sans-Serif Bold Capital H,” or it might just say nothing at all.

By using fake bold, you’re making your content unreadable for a significant part of your audience. It’s an exclusive practice that goes against the spirit of professional networking.

#### 2. Your Content Becomes Unsearchable

LinkedIn’s search function doesn’t recognize these special Unicode characters as regular letters. If you write a post about **marketing strategies** using fake bold, your post won’t show up when someone searches for “marketing strategies.”

You’re effectively hiding your most important keywords from anyone trying to find your content. This hurts your visibility and makes it harder for your target audience to discover you.

#### 3. It Can Look Broken on Different Devices

While most modern devices can display these Unicode characters correctly, some older Android phones and other devices can’t. On those screens, your carefully crafted bold text might just appear as a series of empty boxes (☐☐☐). It looks unprofessional and makes your message impossible to read.

## A Better Way: Use Markdown for Easy and Accessible Formatting

So, if the manual Unicode method is a bad idea, what’s the alternative? The answer is simple: **markdown**.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you add formatting to plain text. It’s the standard for developers and writers for a reason. It’s easy to learn, easy to read, and it converts perfectly to other formats.

To make text bold in markdown, you just wrap it in two asterisks. Like this:

`**This text will be bold.**`

Of course, you can’t just paste markdown directly into LinkedIn. You need a tool to convert it first. That’s where we come in.

### The Easiest Workflow: MarkdownToLinkedIn

Our free [MarkdownToLinkedIn converter](/) is designed to solve this exact problem. It gives you the best of both worlds: an easy writing experience and perfectly formatted, fully accessible LinkedIn posts.

Here’s how it works:

1.  **Write your post in our editor using simple markdown.**
2.  **Use `**bold**` for bold text and `*italic*` for italics.**
3.  **Click “Copy” to convert your post.**
4.  **Paste it into LinkedIn.**

The tool automatically converts your markdown into the correct Unicode characters, but it does so intelligently. It ensures the output is as accessible and searchable as possible, avoiding the major pitfalls of manual generators.

## Write Better, Not Just Bolder

Formatting can make your posts more readable and engaging. But it should never come at the cost of accessibility or discoverability. While you *can* make text bold on LinkedIn without any tools, it’s a hack with serious consequences.

Instead of relying on tricks, focus on a better workflow. Writing in markdown is a more professional and efficient way to create content. It keeps your text clean and structured, and with the right tool, you can be sure your posts look great and are readable by everyone.
