You want your LinkedIn posts to grab attention. A well-placed bold word can make a key point pop, guide your reader’s eye, and break up long blocks of text. But you’ve probably noticed there’s no bold button on LinkedIn. So, how does everyone do it?

There are two ways to get bold text in your LinkedIn posts. You can do it manually, without any special tools, by using what are called Unicode characters. It’s a bit of a process, but it works. Or, you can use a simple Markdown converter for a much faster workflow.

This guide will show you how to do it the manual way and explain why a tool is often a better choice.

### The Short Answer: Manual vs. Tool

For those short on time, here's a quick comparison of the two methods.

| Method | How It Works | Speed | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Manual (Unicode)** | Copy-pasting text from a Unicode generator website. | Slow | Bolding just one or two words occasionally. |
| **Markdown Converter** | Writing with simple symbols (like `**bold**`) and converting. | Fast | People who want an efficient writing workflow. |

### The Manual Method: A DIY Guide to Unicode Bold

When you see bold text on LinkedIn, you aren’t actually seeing formatted text. You’re seeing special Unicode characters that just *look* like bold letters. LinkedIn’s post editor treats them like any other character, such as an emoji.

Doing this by hand is a bit of a chore, but it’s possible. Here’s how.

**Step 1: Find a Unicode Text Generator**

First, you need a website that can convert your standard text into these special characters. There are many free options available. A popular one is YayText, but a quick search for “unicode text generator” will give you plenty of choices.

**Step 2: Generate Your Bold Text**

Type the word or phrase you want to bold into the generator. The site will instantly produce several styled versions of your text. Find the simple bold style (it’s usually labeled “Bold (sans-serif)” or something similar) and click the “copy” button next to it.

**Step 3: Paste it into LinkedIn**

Finally, go back to your LinkedIn post editor and simply paste the copied text where you want it. It should appear bold right in the editor. That’s it. You’ve manually created bold text.

### The Problems with the Manual Method

While the manual approach works, it comes with some significant downsides you should be aware of. These issues can affect who can read your content and whether it gets found in search.

**1. It’s Bad for Accessibility**

This is the biggest issue. Screen readers, which are used by people with visual impairments, often can’t read these special Unicode characters correctly. A screen reader might spell out the character names, read them as question marks, or just skip them entirely. This makes your content confusing or impossible to understand for a part of your audience.

**2. It Hurts Your Post’s Searchability**

LinkedIn’s search function doesn’t recognize these Unicode characters as standard letters. If you bold an important keyword like “**project management**,” your post may not show up when someone searches for “project management.” You’re essentially hiding your most important terms from search.

**3. It Can Look Broken on Some Devices**

On older Android phones or certain operating systems, these special characters don’t always render correctly. Instead of bold text, your reader might just see a series of empty boxes (☐☐☐). This makes your post look broken and unprofessional.

### A Better Way: The Markdown Workflow

The manual method is fine for a word here or there, but it’s inefficient for formatting a whole post. If you want to write and format your content efficiently, using a Markdown-based workflow is a much better approach.

Markdown is a simple way to write formatted text using plain characters you can type on any keyboard. For example, to make a word bold, you just wrap it in two asterisks, like this: `**this is bold**`.

Our tool, [MarkdownToLinkedIn.com](https://markdowntolinkedin.com/), is built for this exact purpose. You can write your entire post using simple Markdown, paste it into the tool, and it instantly converts everything to the correct LinkedIn-compatible format. It handles all the Unicode conversion for you, so you get the speed of Markdown without the copy-paste hassle.

It’s a faster, more organized way to create well-formatted content, giving you more time to focus on the message itself.

### Final Thoughts

Making text bold in a LinkedIn post without special tools is possible, but it’s a manual process with real drawbacks for accessibility and search. It’s a good trick to know if you’re in a pinch.

But for a truly effective content workflow, consider adopting a Markdown-first approach. It keeps your writing clean, organized, and ready to be formatted for LinkedIn in seconds. Give it a try; your productivity will thank you.
