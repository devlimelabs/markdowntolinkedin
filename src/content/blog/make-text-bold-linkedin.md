You want your LinkedIn posts to stand out. You’ve seen others use bold text to grab attention, and you want to do the same. But when you look for the formatting buttons, you find… nothing. So, how do they do it?

It turns out there’s a trick involving special characters. You can do it yourself, completely free, without any special tools. It just takes a little copy-and-paste work.

This guide shows you the manual DIY method for bolding text. We’ll also cover the important downsides you need to know, like issues with screen readers. And finally, we’ll introduce a much simpler workflow for formatting your posts.

### TL;DR: How to Make Text Bold

| Method | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Manual Unicode** | You copy and paste special bold-looking characters one by one. | Free, no tools needed. | Time-consuming, bad for accessibility and search. |
| **Formatting Tool** | A tool automatically converts your text to the right characters. | Fast, easy, consistent. | Relies on an external tool. |

### The Secret to Bold Text on LinkedIn

LinkedIn doesn’t have a built-in way to format posts with bold or italic text. When you see bold text on the platform, you’re not actually seeing formatted text. You’re seeing **Unicode characters**.

Unicode is a standard that assigns a unique code to every character, symbol, and emoji. Within this massive library, there are characters that look just like the bold letters of the alphabet. For example, the standard letter "a" is a different character from the Unicode symbol "𝗮".

By replacing standard letters with their bold-looking Unicode counterparts, you can create the visual effect of bold text anywhere on LinkedIn.

### How to Manually Make Text Bold (The DIY Method)

You don’t need a fancy tool to do this. All you need is a source for the bold Unicode characters and the ability to copy and paste. It’s a bit tedious, but it works.

Here’s a table of the mathematical sans-serif bold characters you can use. Just find the letter you need, copy it, and paste it into your LinkedIn post.

**Sans-Serif Bold Unicode Characters**

| Uppercase | Lowercase |
|---|---|
| 𝗔 | 𝗮 |
| 𝗕 | 𝗯 |
| 𝗖 | 𝗰 |
| 𝗗 | 𝗱 |
| 𝗘 | 𝗲 |
| 𝗙 | 𝗳 |
| 𝗚 | 𝗴 |
| 𝗛 | 𝗵 |
| 𝗜 | 𝗶 |
| 𝗝 | 𝗷 |
| 𝗞 | 𝗸 |
| 𝗟 | 𝗹 |
| 𝗠 | 𝗺 |
| 𝗡 | 𝗻 |
| 𝗢 | 𝗼 |
| 𝗣 | 𝗽 |
| 𝗤 | 𝗾 |
| 𝗥 | 𝗿 |
| 𝗦 | 𝘀 |
| 𝗧 | 𝘁 |
| 𝗨 | 𝘂 |
| 𝗩 | 𝘃 |
| 𝗪 | 𝘄 |
| 𝗫 | 𝘅 |
| 𝗬 | 𝘆 |
| 𝗭 | 𝘇 |

For example, to write **Hello**, you would copy and paste five separate characters: 𝗛, 𝗲, 𝗹, 𝗹, and 𝗼.

### Important: The Downsides of Using Unicode

Before you go all-in on Unicode formatting, you need to understand the drawbacks. While it looks cool, this method has significant problems, especially regarding accessibility.

1.  **Screen Readers Can’t Read It:** This is the biggest issue. As accessibility expert Per Axbom explains, screen readers for visually impaired users often skip these characters entirely or read them out as confusing mathematical symbols. Your bolded message becomes gibberish or is completely lost.

2.  **It’s Bad for Search:** LinkedIn’s search function doesn’t recognize these Unicode symbols as standard text. If you bold an important keyword, your post won’t show up when people search for that term. You’re essentially hiding your content from search.

3.  **It Can Look Broken on Some Devices:** On older operating systems, particularly Android, these special characters may not render correctly. Instead of bold text, your audience might just see a series of empty boxes (□□□).

Because of these issues, you should **never use Unicode formatting for essential information**. Use it sparingly for visual flair, but keep your main message in plain, accessible text.

### A Much Easier Way: The Markdown Workflow

Manually copying and pasting letters is a pain. It’s slow, and it’s easy to make mistakes. A much more efficient way to format your posts is by writing them in Markdown first.

Markdown is a simple syntax that uses plain characters to indicate formatting. For example, you just wrap your text in two asterisks to make it bold, like `**this**`.

This is where a tool like [MarkdownToLinkedIn.com](https://markdowntolinkedin.com) comes in. Here’s the workflow:

1.  **Write your post in Markdown.** You can use your favorite text editor and focus on your content without worrying about formatting.
2.  **Paste your Markdown into the converter.**
3.  **The tool instantly converts it** to a LinkedIn-compatible post, using the correct Unicode characters for formatting.

This approach is faster, less error-prone, and lets you keep all your content in a simple, portable format. You get the visual benefit of bold text without the manual hassle.

### So, Should You Bold Your Text?

Formatting can make your posts more scannable and engaging. But doing it manually is a chore, and the accessibility trade-offs are serious.

If you want to add emphasis, the best approach is to use a simple, streamlined workflow. Write in Markdown, use a converter to handle the tricky character replacements, and always prioritize clarity over decoration. Your readers (and their screen readers) will thank you.
