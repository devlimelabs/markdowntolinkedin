You’ve seen it. A LinkedIn post with a bolded first line that grabs your attention. You look for the formatting toolbar, but it’s not there. So, how do they do it? And more importantly, should you?

Making text bold in a LinkedIn post isn’t straightforward. There’s no native “bold” button. But people do it all the time using a workaround. It involves copying and pasting text from a special generator. You can do it without any special software, but there are some serious downsides you need to know about.

This guide will show you exactly how to make text bold manually. We’ll also dig into why this popular “hack” can actually hurt your post’s reach and accessibility. And we’ll show you a better way.

### The Short Answer: How It Works (and Why It’s Tricky)

If you’re in a hurry, here’s the quick summary of your options for bolding text on LinkedIn.

| Method | How It Works | The Catch (and it’s a big one) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unicode Text Generators** | You paste your text into a free web tool, and it spits out text that *looks* bold. You then copy and paste this into LinkedIn. | The “bold” text isn’t actually bold. It’s a string of mathematical symbols that look like bold letters. This makes your text unreadable to screen readers and invisible to search engines. |
| **Copying from Word/Docs** | You bold text in a word processor and paste it into LinkedIn. | This is unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. The formatting often gets lost in translation. |
| **LinkedIn Articles** | You can use full formatting, including real bold text, when you write a LinkedIn Article. | Articles are different from Posts. They are more like blog posts and don’t appear in the main feed in the same way. |
| **Markdown Converters** | You write in Markdown (`**like this**`) and use a tool like ours to convert it to the right format for LinkedIn. | This is the easiest and most consistent workflow, but it still relies on the same Unicode trick. The benefit is in the workflow, not the underlying technology. |


### The Real Reason You Can’t Just Bold Text on LinkedIn

LinkedIn posts are, by design, plain text. The platform simply doesn’t include the rich-text formatting options you might find in a word processor or even in LinkedIn’s own “Article” feature. The goal is to keep the feed clean and uniform.

This is a deliberate choice. It ensures that posts are readable and consistent across all devices, from a desktop browser to a mobile app. But it leaves content creators wanting more ways to make their posts stand out.

That’s where the workarounds come in.

### The Manual Method: Using a Unicode Text Generator

This is the most common way people create bold text for LinkedIn. It doesn’t require any special tools, just a web browser.

Here’s how you do it:

1.  **Find a Unicode Text Generator.** There are many free options online. A popular one is YayText, but a quick search for “bold text generator” will give you plenty of choices.
2.  **Type Your Text.** Enter the word or phrase you want to make bold into the generator’s text box.
3.  **Copy the “Bold” Version.** The tool will generate several styled versions of your text. Find the one that looks like standard bold text and click the “copy” button.
4.  **Paste it into LinkedIn.** Go back to your LinkedIn post and paste the copied text. It should appear bold.

Simple, right? On the surface, yes. But what’s happening under the hood is what causes problems.

### The Hidden Cost of “Fake” Bold Text

You’re not actually bolding the text. You’re replacing standard letters with a different set of characters from the Unicode library. For example, the letter “B” is replaced with “𝐁”, which is technically the “Mathematical Bold Capital B” symbol.

It looks bold to you. But to a computer, it’s a completely different character. And that has serious consequences.

#### 1. It Breaks Accessibility

People with visual impairments often use screen readers to browse the web. These tools read the content of a webpage aloud. When a screen reader encounters normal text, it reads it perfectly. When it encounters Unicode “bold” text, it often gets confused.

Instead of reading the word “Bold”, it might read out the name of each individual symbol (“Mathematical Bold Capital B, Mathematical Bold Small O...”) or, in some cases, just say “blank.”

Using fake bold text can make your content completely inaccessible to a portion of your audience. As Luise Freese, a Microsoft MVP, puts it in her excellent article on the topic, “If it only works for sighted users, it doesn’t really work.”

#### 2. It’s Bad for SEO and Search

LinkedIn’s search function, and Google’s for that matter, works by indexing plain text. When you use Unicode characters, your text becomes invisible to search.

If you write a post about “**productivity**” using fake bold, your post will not show up when someone searches for “productivity” on LinkedIn. You’ve effectively hidden your most important keywords from the platform’s search algorithm.

#### 3. It Can’t Be Translated

Automatic translation tools also struggle with Unicode characters. If someone from another country tries to translate your post, the fake bold text will likely be left as a garbled mess of symbols.

### A Better Way: The Markdown-to-LinkedIn Workflow

So if the manual Unicode method is so problematic, what’s the alternative? The best approach is to focus on a smart and efficient workflow that still allows for some visual flair.

This is where writing in Markdown comes in. Markdown is a simple syntax for formatting text. You’ve probably used it before on platforms like Reddit or GitHub. To make text bold in Markdown, you just wrap it in two asterisks, `**like this**`.

Our tool, [MarkdownToLinkedIn.com](https://markdowntolinkedin.com/), is designed to bridge the gap. You can write your post using simple Markdown, and the tool will instantly convert it to the right format for LinkedIn, complete with a live preview.

Yes, it still uses the same Unicode characters. The problem of accessibility and searchability remains. But it offers a few key advantages:

*   **It’s Fast.** Writing in Markdown is much quicker than manually converting every bolded phrase in a separate tool.
*   **It’s Consistent.** You get a consistent output every time, without having to worry about which font style to choose from a generator.
*   **It’s a Professional Workflow.** Many writers and developers already write their content in Markdown. This tool fits right into that existing workflow.

### Best Practices for Formatting Your LinkedIn Posts

Bold text can be effective, but it should be used sparingly. Think of it like a highlighter. If you highlight everything, nothing stands out.

Here are a few tips for formatting your posts thoughtfully:

*   **Use Bold for Key Phrases Only.** A single bolded phrase at the beginning of your post can be a great hook. Don’t overdo it.
*   **Use Line Breaks.** The easiest way to make your posts more readable is to use short paragraphs and plenty of white space. Break up long walls of text.
*   **Use Emojis and Symbols.** A well-placed emoji or a simple bullet point (like • or ▪) can add visual structure to your post without hurting accessibility.
*   **Prioritize Clarity.** Your goal is to communicate an idea. Don’t let fancy formatting get in the way of a clear message.

### The Final Word

While you can make text bold in a LinkedIn post without any special tools, the manual method is risky. It creates significant accessibility issues and can harm your post’s visibility.

If you choose to use bold text, do so with a clear understanding of the trade-offs. Use it sparingly for emphasis, and never for essential information or keywords.

For a more efficient and professional approach, consider adopting a Markdown workflow. It streamlines the content creation process and gives you a clear preview of how your post will look.
