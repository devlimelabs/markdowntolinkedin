You’ve seen it on your LinkedIn feed. A post with **bold text** that grabs your attention and makes you stop scrolling. You want to do the same for your own content, but when you look for the formatting options, you find… nothing. No bold button, no keyboard shortcut. So, how do they do it?

Many people turn to third-party tools, but what if you want to make text bold in LinkedIn posts without special tools? Can it be done? The short answer is yes, but it comes with some important trade-offs. This guide will show you the manual methods that work, explain the technical reasons behind them, and reveal why the most common approach might be hurting your post’s reach and accessibility.

## TL;DR: How to Bold Text on LinkedIn Manually

For those in a hurry, here’s a quick summary of your options for making text bold in LinkedIn posts without dedicated formatting tools.

| Method | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Copy & Paste** | Write text in a word processor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, apply bold formatting, and then copy and paste it into your LinkedIn post. | Simple and quick for basic formatting. | Inconsistent results; formatting can be lost during the copy-paste process. |

## Why Doesn't LinkedIn Have a Bold Button?

It seems like a simple feature to add, right? Most platforms, from email clients to blogging software, have basic text formatting. LinkedIn’s decision to omit a bold button from its main post editor is intentional. The platform prioritizes a clean, uniform look for its feed, and allowing everyone to use different formatting could lead to a cluttered and inconsistent user experience.

LinkedIn wants the focus to be on the content of the post, not on flashy formatting. By limiting the options, they encourage a more professional and standardized appearance across the platform. However, this leaves content creators looking for ways to make their key points stand out. That’s where the manual methods come in.

## Method 1: The Copy-Paste Trick from Word or Google Docs

One of the simplest ways to get bold text into a LinkedIn post is to borrow the formatting from another application. Word processors like Google Docs and Microsoft Word have full formatting capabilities, and sometimes, that formatting can survive the copy-paste journey to LinkedIn.

Here’s how to try it:

1.  Open a new document in Google Docs or Microsoft Word.
2.  Type out the text you want to make bold.
3.  Highlight the text and apply bold formatting using the **B** button or the `Ctrl+B` shortcut.
4.  Copy the bolded text.
5.  Paste it directly into the LinkedIn post editor.

### Does It Actually Work?

Sometimes. The success of this method is inconsistent. It often works for simple bold and italic formatting, but it’s not a guaranteed solution. The formatting can be stripped away during the paste, leaving you with plain text. It’s a quick trick to try, but don’t be surprised if it doesn’t work every time.

## Method 2: Use the LinkedIn Article Editor

If you want full, native control over your formatting, LinkedIn does offer a solution: the article editor. LinkedIn Articles are different from regular posts. They are more like blog posts that live on your profile and can be much longer and more detailed. The article editor includes a full suite of formatting tools, including bold, italics, headings, and bullet points.

To use this method:

1.  From the LinkedIn homepage, click “Write article” at the top of the page.
2.  This will open the article editor, where you can write your content.
3.  Highlight any text and use the formatting toolbar to make it bold.

While this gives you the formatting you want, it’s important to remember that this creates a LinkedIn Article, not a standard post. Articles are displayed differently on your profile and have a different reach and engagement pattern than regular posts. This method is best for long-form content, not for your everyday updates.

## The Unicode Method: A Word of Caution

You may have heard about Unicode text generators. These are online tools that promise to give you bold, italic, and other fancy text styles that you can paste into social media platforms like LinkedIn. They work by swapping standard letters for special characters from the Unicode library that look like bold letters.

For example, instead of the standard letter ‘B’, they use the character ‘𝐁’, which is technically a “Mathematical Bold Capital B”. To the human eye, it looks like a bold letter. But to a computer, it’s a completely different character.

### The Problem with Unicode Bold

While Unicode text might look good, it creates significant problems for accessibility and searchability. Here’s why you should avoid it:

*   **Screen Readers Can’t Read It:** People with visual impairments use screen readers to navigate the web. These tools read the text on a page out loud. When a screen reader encounters a Unicode bold character, it doesn’t know what to do. It might read it as “Mathematical Bold Capital B” or, in many cases, it might just skip the text entirely. This means that a portion of your audience won’t be able to access your content at all.

*   **Your Text Becomes Unsearchable:** Because Unicode bold uses special characters, the text is not searchable. If you write a post about **marketing strategies** using Unicode bold, your post won’t show up when someone searches for “marketing strategies” on LinkedIn. It also won’t be found by search engines like Google, and users won’t even be able to find it on the page using the browser’s find function (`Ctrl+F`).

Using Unicode bold is like creating an image of your text instead of actual text. It’s a visual trick that sacrifices function for form. It’s better to use formatting methods that are accessible to everyone.

## The Best Solution: A Markdown to LinkedIn Converter

So, if the manual methods are inconsistent and the Unicode method is a bad idea, what’s the best way to format your LinkedIn posts? The answer is to use a tool that was designed for this exact purpose: a Markdown to LinkedIn converter.

Markdown is a simple way to write formatted text using plain text characters. For example, to make a word bold in Markdown, you just surround it with two asterisks, like this: `**bold text**`. A Markdown to LinkedIn converter, like the one we’ve built at MarkdownToLinkedIn.com, takes your Markdown text and converts it into the appropriate format for LinkedIn, ensuring that it’s both visually appealing and fully accessible.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds. You can write your posts in a simple, clean format, and the converter handles the rest. It’s the most reliable and accessible way to get the formatting you want in your LinkedIn posts.
