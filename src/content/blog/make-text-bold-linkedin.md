You’ve seen them. LinkedIn posts with bold text that grabs your attention. It’s a simple trick, but it makes a huge difference in a sea of plain text. You might think you need a special tool or app to do it. You don’t.

It’s possible to make text bold on LinkedIn using nothing more than your browser. It’s all about understanding a little trick involving Unicode characters. This guide shows you how to do it manually and explains why a simple markdown converter is often a better choice.

## TL;DR: How to Make Text Bold

Don't have time for the details? Here's the quick version.

| Method | How It Works | Best For | Downside |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unicode Generators** | Copy-paste from a web tool that converts text to bold Unicode characters. | Quick, one-off formatting. | Can be tedious for long posts. |
| **Markdown Conversion** | Write in Markdown (`**bold**`), then use a tool to convert it to LinkedIn-ready format. | Efficient workflow, especially for developers. | Requires a conversion step. |
| **Direct Copy-Paste** | Copy already-bolded text from another source (like a website or document). | Very fast if you find what you need. | Unreliable; formatting often breaks. |

## The Secret: It’s Not Really Bold Text

Here’s the surprising part. LinkedIn doesn’t actually support bold formatting in posts. Not in the way a word processor does. When you see bold text on LinkedIn, you’re not seeing formatted text; you’re seeing a different set of characters altogether.

These characters come from a special block in the Unicode standard called **Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols**. They look like bold letters to us, but to a computer, `A` and `𝐀` are two completely different things. The first is the standard letter "A", and the second is the "Mathematical Bold Capital A".

This is a clever workaround, but it comes with some important trade-offs you need to know about.

## Method 1: Use a Unicode Text Generator

This is the most common DIY method. You don’t need to install anything. Just use a free web tool.

1.  **Find a Generator:** Search for a "Unicode text generator" or "bold text generator". There are many free options available.
2.  **Type Your Text:** Write the text you want to make bold into the tool’s input box.
3.  **Copy the Result:** The tool will instantly generate several styled versions. Find the simple bold version and copy it.
4.  **Paste into LinkedIn:** Paste the copied text directly into your LinkedIn post, comment, or even your profile headline.

It’s that simple. The copied text carries its "bold" appearance with it because it’s made of those special Unicode characters.

## Method 2: The Markdown-to-LinkedIn Workflow (Recommended)

If you write content regularly, especially if you’re a developer or writer familiar with Markdown, the generator method gets old fast. A much smoother workflow is to write your content in Markdown and then convert it.

Markdown is a simple syntax for formatting text. To make something bold, you just wrap it in two asterisks, like `**this**`.

Our tool, [MarkdownToLinkedIn.com](https://markdowntolinkedin.com/), was built specifically for this. You can write your entire post in a plain text editor using standard Markdown for bold, italics, and lists. When you’re done, you paste the whole thing into the converter, and it instantly prepares it for LinkedIn.

This approach is more efficient because you can focus on writing, not on formatting. It keeps your hands on the keyboard and separates the writing process from the publishing step.

## The Big Warning: Accessibility and SEO Problems

Using Unicode characters for bolding isn’t a perfect solution. There are two major problems you must consider.

First, **screen readers often can’t read them**. For visually impaired users who rely on screen readers, your bolded text might be skipped entirely or read out as a confusing string of character names. As Per Axbom notes in his article on the topic, this practice is detrimental to accessibility.

Second, **this text is not searchable**. LinkedIn’s search function won’t find keywords inside your Unicode-bolded text. If you write a post about "**product management**", and you bold that key phrase, your post won’t show up when someone searches for "product management".

Because of these issues, you should follow a simple rule: **don’t use bold for essential information or keywords.** Use it for visual emphasis on words that aren’t critical for search or core meaning.

## So, When Should You Use Bold Text?

Bold text is great for breaking up long blocks of text and guiding the reader’s eye. It adds visual hierarchy to your posts, making them easier to scan.

Use it for:
- **Section headers** to structure a long post.
- **Drawing attention** to a non-essential but interesting point.
- **Adding visual punch** to a call-to-action.

Just remember to keep the core, searchable message in plain text.

## Make Your Posts Stand Out

Making your text bold on LinkedIn is a great way to improve readability and make your content more engaging. While you don’t need special tools, using a Markdown-to-LinkedIn converter provides a much more efficient and repeatable workflow.
